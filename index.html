    <p id="intro1">On a Friday night in the middle of June, I sat alone in my apartment that I had just recently moved into.</p>
    <p id="intro2">It was late at night when the craving hit me,</p>
    <p id="intro3">a sudden almost irresistible urge for <span>a large bottle of Root Beer</span></p>

  <div id="oneA">
    <p id="oneA1">I decided to ignore my craving for a Root Beer. </p>
    <p id="oneA2">I know I have a really hard time controlling myself around soda and since I was not living on my own I knew I had to be my own adult and not just buy stuff <span>whenever</span> I got a craving for it. </p>
    <p id="oneA3">But as I sat in my apartment, I could not get the thought of an ice-cold Root Beer out of my head. </p>
  </div>
  <div id="oneB">
    <p id="oneB1">The 7–11 was only a block from my house, it would just be a short quick walk to get the Root Beer. I had only recently just finished a shift at my job and I definitely deserved a treat for myself.</p>
    <p id="oneB2">I got up and grabbed my keys and my wallet and when I went to go grab my keys, I thought, I’m only going a single block and will only be gone for like 5 minutes.</p>
    <p id="oneB3">I don’t <span>need</span> to take my phone with me everywhere.</p>
    <p id="oneB4">I left my apartment with my wallet and keys in hand and went off to go and buy myself a Root Beer.</p>

  <div id="twoA">
    <p id="twoA1">I stand in the elevator and wait as my painfully slow elevator creaks and groans it’s way up to the 3rd floor. </p>
    <p id="twoA2">As I am standing in the elevator my Big Gulp in my right hand is dripping with perspiration and my hand wet from holding the cup. I reach the floor and the elevator doors open. </p>
    <p id="twoA3">The Big Gulp switches hands so I can reach in my pocket to pull out my <span>keys</span></p>
    <p id="twoA4">I hold my keys in my hand but the perspiration from the Big Gulp makes them hard to hold on to as my keys</p>
    <p id="twoA5">fall from my <span>grasp</span></p>
  </div>
  <div id="twoB">
    <p id="twoB1">As I stand in the elevator, I ideally twirl my keys around my index finger.</p>
    <p id="twoB2">In my absent-minded state, the keys move closer and closer to the end of my finger as the spin around it.</p>
    <p id="twoB3">I obliviously sip my Root Beer as my key move ever closer to flying off my finger. The doors of the elevator open.</p>
    <p id="twoB4">I move to exit the elevator and the keys that are swing around my finger fly off into the air. </p>

  <div id="twoC">
    <div id="twoC-partOne">
      <p id="twoC1">I watched as in slow motion my keys slipped from my hand,</p>
      <p id="twoC2">tumbled through the air,</p>
      <p id="twoC3">landed with a <span>thud</span> on the floor right by the thin black slit tha separated theelevator and the building's floor</p>
      <p id="twoC4">then I watched in horror as they <span>slid</span> into the dark abyss that was the elevator shaft.</p>

    <div id="twoC-partTwo">
      <p id="twoC5">Now an easy thing to do in this situation would be to just call up my roommate or parents but unfortunately, I had left my apartment with just my keys and wallet in hand and left my phone locked inside my apartment.</p>
      <p id="twoC6"> I was just going one block away to get a 7-11 Big Gulp. Now I was essentially stranded, all because I was missing two small items <span> a phone and key.</span></p>
      <p id="twoC7">So there I was, standing in the elevator trying to process my circumstances. I started <span>running</span> through my options.</p>
      <p id="twoC8">I could call for help</p>
      <p id="twoC9" class="gray">but no cellphone means I can't contact anyone</p>
      <p id="twoC10">I can try to get to a friend's house,</p>
      <p id="twoC11" class="gray">only everyone is back home for the summer</p>
      <p id="twoC12">I could try to pick my lock,</p>
      <p id="twoC13" class="gray">but I have no idea how to pick a lock</p>
      <p id="twoC14">I could try to climb in through a window,</p>
      <p id="twoC15" class="gray">only my apartment is three stories up and I have never climbed anything hirer than a 3-foot fence</p>

    <p id="threeA1">After a few minutes of panicking in front of my door, I decided to try and see if any of my neighbors could help me. </p>
    <p id="threeA2">Knocking on the door of the apartment next to mine, a lady in her early 20s answered the door. </p>
    <p id="threeA3">After explaining my situation to her, she kindly allowed me to borrow her phone to call someone. </p>
    <p id="threeA4">In my panicked state, the only number I could remember was my home phone number. </p>
    <p id="threeA5">After dialing the number the phone began to <span>ring</span><span class="ring1 repeat">ring</span><span class="ring2 repeat">ring</span><span class="ring3 repeat">ring</span><span class="ring4 repeat">ring</span><span class="ring5 repeat">ring</span><span class="ring6 repeat">ring</span><span class="ring7 repeat">ring</span><span class="ring8 repeat">ring</span><span class="ring9 repeat">ring</span> no answer.</p>
    <p id="threeA6">I gave the phone back to my neighbor and she shut the door, leaving my to my own devices.</p>

  <div id="threeB">
    <p id="threeB1">I quickly started going into panic mode. I desperately tried to pick my lock with anything that I had on me.</p>
    <p id="threeB2">By the end of my attempt, I had broken 3 random cards I had in my wallet.</p>
    <p id="threeB3">I tried desperately to push or even break in my door but it would not <span>budge</span></p>
    <p id="threeB4">After many attempts to break into my own apartment, I sat down on the ground and just started </p>
    <p id="threeB5">crying</p>
  </div>
  <div id="threeC">
    <p id="threeC1">So I sat outside my door, so close to sanctuary yet so far and tried to figure out what to do. I could not just sit in the hallway all night, I had to do something proactive.</p>
    <p id="threeC2">After realizing that I could not sit inside my apartment hallway all night I decided to just go and walk around the city. </p>
    <p id="threeC3"> With no way of contacting anyone the only option I could come up with was to take an hour and a half train back to parents’ house in northeast Philly</p>
    <p id="threeC4">hope that they were still awake by the time I got there.</p>

      <p id="fourA2">Sitting on the doorstep to my parents’ house, in full view of anyone would look towards the house started to make me nervous so I decided that maybe it would be safer to sit out back of my house where no one could see me. </p>
      <p id="fourA3">I took a seat on the <span>cold, hard ground</span> of my driveway and tried to get comfortable for a very long night. </p>
      <p id="fourA4">As I sat outside my stomach kept rumbling.I came to the decision that it was probably better to deal with my hunger by getting some food in a diner then it was to spend the entire night sitting outside my house.</p>
      <p id="fourA5">After another 30 minutes of sitting in front of my house, I decided to go to a 24-hour diner, which was at least an hour walk away. </p>
